You can pass any attribute you'd normally pass to a `img` html tag. You can pass the following props to configure the effect:\r\n\r\n* aperture (0-100): the amount of area that is in focus. 10 would mean one tenth of the image is sharp.\r\n* blur (0-10): the blur radius in pixels. Something between 1 or 2 usually gives the best results.\r\n* direction (“horizontal”, “vertical”, or 0-360): the direction of the effect with zero at right.\r\n* position (0-100): defines the point of focus. 50 would be the image middle.\r\n* smoothness (0-100): the amount of area between complete focus and complete blur. The higher the value, the “smoother\" the blur.\r\n\r\n##### Demo\r\n\r\n*Before:*\r\n\r\n![screen-shot-2015-05-26-at-8 39 40-am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/566971/7811816/9757830c-0383-11e5-88c7-6b19a967393e.jpg)\r\n\r\n*After:*\r\n\r\n![screen-shot-2015-05-26-at-8 39 12-am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/566971/7811815/9733d4de-0383-11e5-977b-4862412b3d67.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n* React\r\n* Webpack\r\n* [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)\r\n* [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader)\r\n* [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)\r\n\r\n### Inspiration & Base\r\n\r\n* [jQuery tiltShift.js](http://www.noeltock.com/tilt-shift-css3-jquery-plugin/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
